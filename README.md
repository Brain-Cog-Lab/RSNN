# Reward-modulated Spiking Neural Network for Self-organizing Collision Avoidance of Drone Swarm 
**Code for paper "Nature-inspired Self-organizing Collision Avoidance for Drones Swarm Based on Reward-modulated Spiking Neural Network".

The collaborative interaction mechanisms of biological swarms in nature are of great importance to inspire the study of swarm intelligence. This paper proposed a self-organizing obstacle avoidance model by drawing on the decentralized, self-organizing properties of intelligent behavior of biological swarms. 




Each individual independently adopts brain-inspired reinforcement learning methods to achieve online learning and makes decentralized decisions based on local
observations. The proposed method enables a drone swarm to emerge with autonomous obstacle avoidance ability in bounded space.
